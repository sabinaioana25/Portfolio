                <h3 class="detail-header-h3" id="problem">Brief</h3>
                <p>
                    The brief was given by the client: they wanted to create an app that holds the score of a snooker match as per the official rules and required a simple but attractive design. As a fan of this sport, I empathised with the client and understood his expectations; by the end of the design process, I had a lot of input from his side and implemented/adapted a lot of features that worked best for the app.
                </p>
                <h3 class="detail-header-h3">solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Target audience: Snooker fans and amateur players who want to use this app to keep track of their score when playing with friends.
                <br>To encourage players to make use of the app and observe their performance over time, a statistics page is implemented: they can view the results from each match they played, in chronological order.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/solo-project-snooker-score-app/snooker-score-feature-ideation.png" class="thumb-proj-ux" id="feature ideation">
                <h3 class="detail-header-h3">feature ideation and prioritization</h3>
                I interviewed three potential users from the target audience to determine what factors influence their decision of digitally keeping track of their score.
                Some of the main decision factors were: <br>
                - able tochoose number of frames, reds on the table and foul value<br>
                - play in multiplayer mode (minimum 2)<br>
                - able to add friends & invite to play<br>
                - can keep track of performance via a <i>statist</i>ics page, while also seeing friends‚Äô rankings <br>
                - able to implement same rules as in a live game (can undo, rerack, remove and concede game) <br>
                - in case of fault, user will have to retake shot, continue or choose free ball shot <br><br>
                Based on the notes taken during the interviews, I built the feature prioritization diagram:<br>
                <img src="../images/solo-project-snooker-score-app/snooker-score-feature-prioritization-diagram.png" class="thumb-proj-ux" id="feature-prior">
                <p>With an idea of the features the app may benefit (apart from the ones already set out), I used an ideation method to begin to understand what would help in building the minimal viable product</p>
                <h3 class="detail-header-h3">wireframing</h3>
                <p>The mock design presents the users with a setup screen where they customize their game by choosing the number of frames to play, the number of red balls and the fault value.</p>
            
                <p>
                    As soon as the players decide to end the current frame or the entire match, their progress can be seen on a separate screen.
