            <p class="short-about"><br>Hello üëã! My name is Sabina Leitoiu and I‚Äôm an android developer 
                with a strong passion towards UX design.</p>
            <p class="short-about">
                <br>I have been living in London for the past 6 years and I have enjoyed the many wonders 
                and attractions the city offers. I spent most of my professional time working as a biomedical 
                engineer specialized in life support equipment, but I have been gravitating towards coding for
                the best part of my short career, with 3 nanodegrees under my belt and a will to succeed and 
                excel in this new field. As part of the Udacity Nanodegree programs, I built unique apps on 
                diverse topics, some chosen by me, some preselected by the curriculum. But each app would have 
                the objective of solving a real world problem and so the hands-on exercises lead to an increase 
                of confidence in my skills and of growing interest in contributing to the welfare of the 
                community through the help of mobile apps. </p> 
                
            <p class="short-about">    
                <br>When I am not working, thinking about coding or designing (an app, my flat or my photography 
                blog), I would be found hiking in the Scottish Highlands, reading or spending precious time
                with friends and family. During the time of writing, the possibility to hang out is not at all 
                encouraged because of the pandemic, so I‚Äôve come to greatly appreciate even the shortest 
                zoom conversation because it‚Äôs managed to keep me sane and has raised hope for a better 
                tomorrow. 
                I am also an avid movie-goer, an explorer and a 70s music enthusiast.
            </p>
